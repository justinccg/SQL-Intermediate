--Step 1: Create Third table 

Create Table WareHouseEmployeeDemographics 
(EmployeeID int, 
FirstName varchar(50), 
LastName varchar(50), 
Age int, 
Gender varchar(50)
)

--Step 2: Add information to it

Insert into WareHouseEmployeeDemographics VALUES
(1013, 'Darryl', 'Philbin', NULL, 'Male'),
(1050, 'Roy', 'Anderson', 31, 'Male'),
(1051, 'Hidetoshi', 'Hasagawa', 40, 'Male'),
(1052, 'Val', 'Johnson', 31, 'Female')

--Step 3: Evaluate 2 nos of tables before creating union query. 

select * from EmployeeDemographics

select * from WareHouseEmployeeDemographics

--Step 4: Create a UNION

--Note: it identifies the ID's which are present in both the tables and exclude the remaining one. 
--If the items in the 2 tables are the same, it makes no sense/ change when we use union. Otherwise, the result may not sound reasonable. 
--Union is like a distinct statement by removing all the duplicate values.
--On the other hand, UNION ALL creates a single selection including all the information from Table 1 and Table 2 by considering the duplicates also.Simply copy paste 2 --tables together.

SELECT * 
from 
EmployeeDemographics
UNION
SELECT * FROM WareHouseEmployeeDemographics
order by EmployeeID

--Step 5: Create a UNOIN between table 1 and table 2 which are having different set of columns.

Select EmployeeID, FirstName, Age
From Employeedemographics
Union
Select EmployeeID, JobTitle, Salary
From EmployeeSalary
Order by EmployeeID

--Note: Observe the weird outcome received from this query.

--Step 6: Observe the result if we select all instead of specific number of columns

Select *
From Employeedemographics
Union
Select *
From EmployeeSalary
Order by EmployeeID

--Step 7: UNION ALL


Select EmployeeID, FirstName, Age
From Employeedemographics
Union ALL
Select EmployeeID, JobTitle, Salary
From EmployeeSalary
Order by EmployeeID

--Note: JobTitle of the second table has considered as First name in the Union all statement.
