--Note:It will be helpful for evaluating large scripts.  
--We could use AS as â€˜Alias name or simply space after the column name will be sufficient enough.


--Step 1: Identify a table 

Select * From employeedemographics 

--Step 2: Method 1 Aliasing a column name

Select FirstName as Fname From employeedemographics 

--Step 3: Method 2 ( Club 2 columns)

Select FirstName+' '+LastName AS FullName
From employeedemographics 

--Step 4: Aliasing a table name

Select Demo.EmployeeID,Sal.Salary
FROM Employeedemographics as Demo
INNER JOIN
EmployeeSalary as Sal
On 
Demo.EmployeeID=Sal.EmployeeID

--Step 5: A little more complex query

Select Demo.EmployeeID,Demo.FirstName, Sal.JobTitle, Ware.Age
FROM EmployeeDemographics Demo
LEFT JOIN EmployeeSalary Sal
ON
Demo.EmployeeID=Sal.EmployeeID
LEFT JOIN WareHouseEmployeeDemographics Ware
ON 
Demo.EmployeeID=Ware.EmployeeID
