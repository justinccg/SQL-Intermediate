--Step 1 : Select table 1 for applying the case statement

Select * from EmployeeDemographics

--Note: Observed that 10 row have proper age mentioned and 2 rows are with NULL Values.

--Step 2: Exclude the NULL Values from the Age column

Select FirstName,LastName, Age
FROM Employeedemographics
WHERE Age is NOT NULL
ORDER BY Age

--Step 3: Use Case statement for this, 2 ways of writing the statement are mentioned

Select FirstName,LastName,Age,
(CASE
WHEN Age > 30 THEN 'Old'
ELSE 'Young'
END) as Category
FROM Employeedemographics
WHERE Age is NOT NULL
ORDER BY Age 


Select FirstName,LastName,Age,
CASE
	WHEN Age > 30 THEN 'Old'
	ELSE 'Young'
END as Category
FROM Employeedemographics
WHERE Age is NOT NULL
ORDER BY Age

--Step4: Apply multiple conditions in a single case statement

Select FirstName,LastName,Age,
CASE
	WHEN Age > 30 THEN 'Old'
	WHEN Age BETWEEN 27 and 30 THEN 'Young'
	ELSE 'Baby'
END as Category
FROM Employeedemographics
WHERE Age is NOT NULL
ORDER BY Age 

--Step 5: Evaluate the sequence of operation of multiple condition check

Select FirstName,LastName,Age,
CASE
	WHEN Age>30 THEN 'Old'
	WHEN Age = 38 THEN 'Stanley'
	ELSE 'Baby'
END
FROM Employeedemographics
WHERE Age is NOT NULL
ORDER BY Age

--Note; Since the first condition was already met, second condition did not process.

--Step 6: The difference in output, if the order of the condition were changed

Select FirstName,LastName,Age,
CASE
	WHEN Age = 38 THEN 'Stanley'
	WHEN Age>30 THEN 'Old'
	ELSE 'Baby'
END
FROM Employeedemographics
WHERE Age is NOT NULL
ORDER BY Age

--Step 7: Joining two table to apply different condition

Select FirstName,LastName,JobTitle,Salary
FROM employeedemographics
Join employeesalary
ON Employeedemographics.EmployeeID= Employeesalary.EmployeeID

--Step 8: Giving a salary increment for different catergory of people

Select FirstName,LastName,JobTitle,Salary,
CASE 
	WHEN JobTitle='Salesman' THEN Salary +(Salary*.10)
	WHEN JobTitle='Accountant' THEN Salary +(Salary*.05)
	WHEN JobTitle='HR' THEN Salary +(Salary*.000001)
	ELSE Salary+(Salary*.03)
END AS SalaryAfterRaise 
FROM employeedemographics
Join Employeesalary
ON Employeedemographics.EmployeeID= Employeesalary.EmployeeID
