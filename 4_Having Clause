--Step1: Arrange a table 

Select * from EmployeeSalary

--Step2: Use a groupby statement 

Select JobTitle, count(JobTitle)
From EmployeeSalary 
Group By jobTitle

--Step3: Use a aggregate function in a where clause and evaluate the error message in the note.
-- Objective is to find the Jobtitle which are more than one person

Select JobTitle, count(JobTitle)
From EmployeeSalary 
Where COUNT(JobTitle)>1
Group By JobTitle

--Note: An aggregate may not appear in the WHERE clause unless it is in a subquery contained in a HAVING clause or a select list, and the column being aggregated is an outer reference.

--Step4: Introduce Having clause before group by statement instead of where clause and evaluate the error message at the note.

Select JobTitle, count(JobTitle)
From EmployeeSalary 
Having COUNT(JobTitle)>1
Group By JobTitle

--Note: Incorrect syntax near 'COUNT'.Since the Having clause completely dependent on group by statement, group by needs to executed first.

--Step5: Introduce having Clause after the group by statement

Select JobTitle, count(JobTitle)
From EmployeeSalary 
Group By JobTitle
Having COUNT (JobTitle) >1

--Step6: Identify AVG salart per Job title

Select JobTitle, AVG(salary)
From EmployeeSalary 
Group By JobTitle
Order by AVG (Salary)

--Step7: Identify the AVG(Salary) more than 45000

Select JobTitle, AVG(salary)
From EmployeeSalary 
Group By JobTitle
Having AVG (Salary)>45000
Order by AVG (Salary)
